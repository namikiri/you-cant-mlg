# You can't go through MLG! 
You can't do math and binary when MLG intensifies! This is a joke game made under impression from "You can't smth under pressure" from usvsth3m. Unfortunately, usvsth3m sold themselves to the "Mirror" website and these games ~~aren't available anymore~~ [are available here](https://www.tomscott.com/usvsth3m/ "are available here"). Despite that I made a fan remake of these games with more pressure of dank MLG memes.

## DISCLAIMER
This game is made for fun. The code is insane as hell, don't even try to clean it up. And don't judge me on it, it's just a joke. Although the game is published under GNU GPL v3 license it applies only to HTML/JS files. Graphic and sound files are distributed with their own licenses. If you are an owner of these files and want me to remove it, please file an issue on this repository.
